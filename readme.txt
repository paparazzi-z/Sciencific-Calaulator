This application is developped in Netbeans. Most of the functions are generated by IDE. I can not separate them in different class or package.

JAVA dependency is JAVA 15.

The instruction of application is at the beginning of 'calculatorGUI.java'.

There are 2 screenshots in the folder which are 2 different modes of the calculator.
